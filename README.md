# Douban FM

â€‹	Douban FM is a simple FM player which I learn from [Laozhen](http://edu.51cto.com/course/course_id-3536.html) and it's an intact project(App) written in Swift 3.0 of mine.There are lots of change by contrast of former version Swift.So it's hard to convert to the latest API.

â€‹	In this project, I have introduce [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) and [SwiftyJSON](https://github.com/SwiftyJSON/SwiftyJSON) libraries to simplify the code instead of original library.
